           <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
           <p class="me">
               I am the oldest of four! I have a little sister who is 15.
               My other sister and my brother are 14. 
               I have two dogs, Ronnie and Fratelli! 
               Fratelli is about to be 7 years old, and Ronnie is 2.
               I am also engaged! I am ot sure when the wedding will be,
               so i guess everyone will have to stay tuned!
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="hobbies">
                When I am not laying around with my dogs
                I love to go to the gym! It is so fun to workout
                and hit new goals. It's also a really nice stress 
                reliever! I also love to crochet. I am fairly new at it,
                but my biggest project so far is a tank top with a matching scrunchy!
                I will say that I do love to trvel as well!
            </p>
            <h2>Why Am I here?</h2>
            <p class="here">Well... when two people tolerate each other sometimes they make a baby.
                Just kidding! <em>kinda</em> I decided to learn how
                to code because it is something I have always been interested in.
                I do think that this is something i would enjoy.
                I do like a challenge and I do love to learn new things!
